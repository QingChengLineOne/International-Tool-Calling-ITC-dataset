    "tool_description": "The Distance Calculation API is incredibly simple to use. Simply provide the latitude and longitude coordinates of the two locations you want to measure and the metric in which you want the result (km, mi, m, feet), and the API will return the distance between them in a user-friendly format. The API uses the latest algorithms and techniques to provide fast and accurate results, making it the ideal solution for developers who need to incorporate distance calculation into their applications.",
