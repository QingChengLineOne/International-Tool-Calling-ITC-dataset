It is based on an algorithm described in 'Programming Classics: Implementing the World's Best Algorithms' by Ian Oliver. The implementation uses recursive calls instead of a stack, which may affect performance. The algorithm has a complexity of O(N**3), where N is the length of the longest string.",
