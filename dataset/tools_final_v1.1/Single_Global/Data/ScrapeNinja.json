Emulates Chrome TLS fingerprint, backed by rotating proxies (geos: US, EU, Brazil, France, Germany, 4G residential proxies available!) and smart retries. Use this when node.js/curl/python fails to load the website even with headers fully identical to Chrome, but you still need fast scraping and want to avoid using Puppeteer and JS evaluation. Javascript rendering is available as well.",
